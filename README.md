#MSRX

MSRX is a patch for Waterfall to fix possible exploits and add useful functionalities. Waterfall is a fork of the well-known BungeeCord server teleportation suite.


Why fork Waterfall?

Waterfall was forked out of a desire for greater protection to be afforded to a Bungeecord-based proxy, which Waterfall currently cannot offer.

MSRX will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.
